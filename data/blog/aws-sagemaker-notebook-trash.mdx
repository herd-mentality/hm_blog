If you delete a lot of files and find that you are still running out of disk space on AWS SageMaker Notebook, this could be due to deleted files still occupying disk space.

To permanently delete files on your Notebook instance, you can run the following commands in a Notebook terminal:

```bash
rm -rf SageMaker/.Trash-1000/
```
