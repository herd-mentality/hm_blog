The following are presentation resources for 'Building Web Applications with Vue.js'.

This was presented internally at work. A modified version that includes hosting/integration with Drupal will be presented in future.

1. Presentation slides (Microsoft PowerPoint)
1. [Code examples](https://github.com/cchew/building-vue.js) (GitHub)

# AI Tools
There is no AI tools/process document for this presentation. 

I did use Google Gemini to generate a starting paper but ended up utilising and refreshing a Dec 2022 presentation on the same topic.

I used Cursor for the weather application (for about 3 hours) and really enjoyed the experience. I might do a 'vibe programming with AI tools' presentation in future.

# The State of Vue.js Report 2025
The slide deck references [The State of Vue.js Report 2025](https://www.monterail.com/stateofvue).

The reason I left out Angular in my slide deck when looking at the Top 1M/100K/10K websites was that the [figure used in the Report was ~372](https://www.monterail.com/#chapter-3) was much lower than the [BuiltWith figure of ~2,000](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Angular-JS). The React and Vue numbers are in the ballpark due to BuiltWith numbers being real-time.
