# (?) Introduction

- Have put the proposed author of each section in the headings but will remove those before publishing

# (CM) Setting up Node.js

- Setting up Node.js for windows and linux/macos?
- npm install to get all packages?

# (CM) Deploying a local development server

- npm run dev or similar to set up a local dev server
- the concept and unhealthily addicting nature of hot reloading

# (DW) Blog data structure

- blog posts are mdx files and go in [dir]
  - short intro to what an mdx file is
- images for those blogs can be any image type (prefer webp, jpg, png) and go in [dir]

# (DW) Extra things

- additional components (ToC) etc
- setting up author cards
- resources to learn React/nextjs if interested in creating or editing custom components

# (DW/CM) Branching strategy in herdmentality/hm-blog 

- feature branches (posts, front-end updates) branch off main and are merged back into main
- to deploy, raise a PR from main to deploy
