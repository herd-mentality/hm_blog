# (?) Introduction

- Have put the proposed author of each section in the headings but will remove those before publishing

# (CM) Setting up Node.js

- Setting up Node.js for windows and linux/macos?
- npm install to get all packages?

# (CM/DW) Cloning hm_blog / opening with VSCode


# (CM) Deploying a local development server

- npm run dev or similar to set up a local dev server
- the concept and unhealthily addicting nature of hot reloading

# (DW) Blog data structure

- This is a NextJS@13 project, so project structure is set up like this: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure


```
📁 hm_blog/
...
│   ├── 📁 data/                       # Stores blog articles and author details   
│   │   ├── 📁 authors/
│   │   ├── 📁 blog/
│   │   │   ├── 📁 <multi-part-post>/
│   │   │   ├── 📄 <blog-post>.mdx
...
│   ├── 📁 public/                     # Stores images and other website assets
│   │   ├── 📁 static/
│   │   │   ├── 📁 images/
│   │   │   │   ├── 📁 <dir-per-post>/ 
...
```


- blog posts are mdx files and go in [dir]
  - short intro to what an mdx file is and why its different to a MD file
- images for those blogs can be any image type (prefer webp, jpg, png) and go in [dir]

# (DW) Extra things

- This is a website built with React, a Javascript front-end web-development library.
- The core concept is reusable and versatile components (think of them as functions that correspond to features on the page).

```
📁 hm_blog/
...
│   ├── 📁 data/                       # Stores blog articles and author details   
│   │   ├── 📁 authors/                # Author details - mdx per author
│   │   │   ├── 📄 <author>.mdx
│   │   ├── 📁 blog/
...
│   ├── 📁 components/                 # Stores components
│   │   ├── 📄 <component>.tsx
...
```

- additional components (ToC) etc
- setting up author cards
- resources to learn React/nextjs if interested in creating or editing custom components

# (DW/CM) Branching strategy in herdmentality/hm-blog 

- feature branches (posts, front-end updates) branch off main and are merged back into main
- to deploy, raise a PR from main to deploy
