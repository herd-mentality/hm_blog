Sometimes you want to clone a Git repository that has large files versioned using Git Large File System (LFS), e.g. with the following command:

```bash
git lfs clone <repository-url>
```

# AWS CloudShell
AWS CloudShell uses 'dnf' so the command to install is:

```bash
sudo dnf install git-lfs
```

Note that due to CloudShell disk size limits (usually I get \<1GB free), you might need to use another option.

# AWS SageMaker Notebook
AWS SageMaker Notebooks use Amazon Linux and the Deep Learning AMIs.
